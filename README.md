# Diarrhea_in_my_area

The "Diarrhea in my Area???" is an Android App that is aimed to make data analysis for the spread of different diseases easier using data that we can gather by just filling basic information about the patient and the disease that we think is essential yet not personal by the hospitals. The app shows different analyses that can be useful to the Government in the disease spread using maps and graphs that make the work easier. While the motivation of the core idea was to acknowledge the spread of the Covid-19 virus, we made the app more flexible by creating and using realtime dynamic data. In today's time, when the spread of the Covid-19 virus is on our heads, the app gives us a more reliable way to know our surroundings and make better decisions to control not only the current virus but any disease that may need such analysis.
